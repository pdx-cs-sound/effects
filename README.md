# Audio Effects
Bart Massey 2022

This is a collection of audio effects implementations in
Python for teaching purposes. The effects include autowah,
chorus, compressor, distortion, reverb. There's a white
noise generator. There's a vibrato (`tremolo.py`) and a
tremolo (`vibrato.py`) as is tradition.

The effects take a wave file input argument, and can take a
second wave file argument as output. Otherwise, they will
play the effected audio.
