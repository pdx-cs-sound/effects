# Audio Effects
Bart Massey 2022

This is a collection of audio effects implementations in
Python for teaching purposes. The included effects are
autowah, chorus, compressor, distortion, reverb. There's
also a white noise generator.

The effects take a wave file input argument, and can take a
second wave file argument as output. Otherwise, they will
play the effected audio.
